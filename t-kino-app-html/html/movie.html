                          <p>This is the tale of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), an ordinary eleven-year-old boy
                            serving as a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard
                            and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is
                            snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the
                            groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him
                            and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends
                            easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more
                            dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards
                            are ones to be trusted.</p>

                      <p class="friend-name">I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like "The Phantom Menace," I've had a
                        very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release,
                        I
                        simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few
                        times
                        each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing
                        thought was "How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?" rather than
                        "How entertaining is this film overall?" I have trouble answering the latter question because I
                        was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd
                        have
                        reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.

                        Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an
                        easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many
                        classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly
                        because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my
                        experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books
                        upon
                        which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the
                        first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this
                        much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has
                        become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star
                        Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the
                        minds
                        of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world
                        that
                        Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to
                        change
                        anything. </p>

                        the
                        characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and
                        fear
                        for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank
                        out,
                        or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film,
                        Harry
                        Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

                        I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that
                        they'll
                        tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters.
                        The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked
                        down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's
                        numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early
                        movies
                        to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was
                        missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and
                        while the "magical" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of
                        them.

                        doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers
                        and
                        should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this
                        movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of
                        the
                        show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize
                        lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act.
                        Daniel
                        Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie,
                        you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids
                        again.
                        I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their
                        performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids
                        had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're
                        looking
                        at things that were added in post production!

                        Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult
                        audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone
                        wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as "guest stars"
                        but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan
                        Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing
                        as
                        the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable
                        Snape,
                        and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these
                        movies!
                        Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word "earwax" to Richard Harris, point
                        out
                        striped cats as "Maggie Smith cats", mumble "Shouldn't have said that," when they make a
                        mistake,
                        or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?

                        First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully
                        capture
                        their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world,
                        there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it
                        exists.
                        Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that
                        can
                        only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great
                        Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect
                        wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an
                        entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

                        Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of
                        the
                        exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name "Fluffy," chess pieces
                        have
                        never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday
                        presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on
                        one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie
                        theaters
                        Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie. </p>
